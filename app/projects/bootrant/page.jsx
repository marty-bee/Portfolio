            <p className="text-left">For this project I lead the team through a user centered design proces. To allow us to rapidly, research, define a solution/mvp and deliver it within the week sprint</p>
            <br/>

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold">Getting started</h3>
            <p>To promote cohesion with the newly formed team we first created a team manifesto to align our ways of working.</p>
            {/* team manifesto image */}
            <div className="h-96 sm:max-h-[500px] md:h-500 overflow-hidden relative box-border rounded-2xl mt-4 mb-4">
                <Image src='/images/bootrant/midtermmanifesto.jpg' alt='Team manifesto' quality={25} fill={true} loading="eager" className="object-scale-down relative"/>
            </div>
            <p>Now we could begin with defining the scope/problem space. Using this as a framework we undertook user and competitor research.</p>
            {/* define problem space */}
                <div className="h-96 sm:max-h-[500px] md:h-500 overflow-hidden relative box-border rounded-2xl">
                    <Image src='/images/bootrant/midtermproblemspace.jpg' alt='Defining the problem space' quality={25} fill={true} loading="eager" className="object-scale-down relative"/>
                </div>
            <p>Using this as a framework informed user and competitor research.</p>
            <p>All of this culminated in a pair of user personas to represent our learnings. Andrew the recent graduate unsure of his place in the world. Sarah the mum to a young family, her years of experience in work causes her to feel a bit lost embarking on a complete career change with people relying on her.</p>
            {/* personas */}
            <div className="h-96 sm:max-h-[500px] md:h-500 overflow-hidden relative box-border rounded-2xl mt-4 mb-4">
                <Image src='/images/bootrant/midtermpersonas.jpg' alt='User personas' fill={true} loading="eager" className="object-scale-down relative"/>
            </div>
            <p>All of this allowed us to finally arrive at a refined problem statement. Thereby allowing us to progress to the next stage of the project, ideation.</p>
            {/* refined problem */}
            <div className="h-96 md:h-500 overflow-hidden relative box-border rounded-2xl mt-4 mb-4">
                <Image src='/images/bootrant/midtermproblemstatements.jpg' alt='Refined problem statement' quality={25} loading="eager" fill={true} className="object-scale-down relative"/>
            </div>
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold">Ideation</h3>
            <p>Ideation was facilitated using the disney ideation method, then the ideas were refined using our personas. Then checked against feasibility given the contstraints of the project. The time pressures meant many solutions had to be shelved and were marked out as grey sticky notes.
            </p>
            {/* ideation image */}
            <div className="h-96 sm:max-h-[500px] md:h-500 overflow-hidden relative box-border rounded-2xl mt-4 mb-4">
                <Image src='/images/bootrant/ideation.jpg' alt='Disney ideation' fill={true} quality={25} loading="eager" className="object-scale-down relative"/>
            </div>
            <p>With the idea nailed down the ideal solution was mapped out then any extrenous features where marked in grey again. Leaving us with a streamlined and deliverable MVP.</p>
            {/*mvp */}
            <div className="h-96 sm:h-500 overflow-hidden relative box-border rounded-2xl mt-4 mb-4">

            </div>
            <p>Designs were rapidly created in lo-fi grey before being refined into hi-fi designs to build. This was accomplished using Figma so we could get a feel for the sizes and flows by viewing them on our own phones.</p>
            {/* designs */}
            <div className="h-96 sm:max-h-[500px] md:h-500 overflow-hidden relative box-border rounded-2xl mt-4 mb-4">

            </div>
            <p>The last step before coding was to finalise the user stories and subsquent tasks so the work could be completed efficiently.</p>
            {/* user stories */}
            <div className="h-96 sm:max-h-[500px] md:h-500 overflow-hidden relative box-border rounded-2xl mt-4 mb-4">

            </div>
            <p>One of the functions I was responsible for was creating the cards on the journal page. The data for these was provided via a fetch request getting all the records from our postgreSQL database.</p>
            {/* fetch image */}
            <div className="h-96 sm:max-h-[500px] md:h-500 overflow-hidden relative box-border rounded-2xl mt-4 mb-4">
                <Image src='/images/bootrant/fetch.png' alt='fetch request function' fill={true} quality={25} className="object-scale-down relative"/>
            </div>
            <p>To the generate the cards I created a series of functions that were called on page load to iterate over the fetched data and manipulate the dom to create the elements in sequence.</p>
            {/* popdom */}
            <div className="h-96 sm:max-h-[500px] md:h-500 overflow-hidden relative box-border rounded-2xl mt-4 mb-4">
                <Image src='/images/bootrant/popdom.png' alt='function to populate the DOM with card elements' quality={25} fill={true} className="object-scale-down relative"/>
            </div>
            <p>With these functions operating the working end result looks like this on a mobile device.</p>
            {/* journal page */}
            <div className="h-96 sm:max-h-[500px] md:h-500 overflow-hidden relative box-border rounded-2xl mt-4 mb-4">
                <Image src='/images/bootrant/journalpage.png' alt='The final journal page' quality={25} fill={true} className="object-scale-down relative"/>
            </div>
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold">Project reflections</h3>
            <p>We achieved our goals for this project. Given more time I would have wanted to define the desktop interface and used media queries to make it happen. As it stands it only truly functions on mobile views. I learnt a lot about DOM manipulation and got to grips with fetch requests during this project. There was a lot of trial and error getting the CSS, JavaScript and HTML to come together to programmatically display content.</p>
